Since most of the delays were caused by Late return from Field Trips, it is recommended that the buses be rotated out to prevent breakdown i.e the buses going out for field trips should be on rotational basis.\n","2.   Heavy traffic is the most frequent reason for running late and hence either the roads be expanded to ease traffic or the number of vehicles plying that route should be regulated. Alternative routes may also be considered.\n","3. An investigation into LITTLE RICHIE BUS SERVICE which is the bus company with the most breakdowns should be launched to understand the reason.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"noZz5YRQXKzi"},"source":["## 6.
