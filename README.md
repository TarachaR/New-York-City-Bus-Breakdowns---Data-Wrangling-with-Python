## External Data Source Validation

The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

> All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

## Understanding The Context

With this project, I'm a Data Analyst working for Hilton International Hotels, and have been tasked to help the management decide on the best strategies that will lead to revenue growth.

I have been provided with a dataset containing information on the various chain of hotels, which more on, includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

Given this dataset, I performed data exploration, data cleaning and analysis and came up with some appropriate recommendations. 

#### Technologies

- Python Programming Language
- Google Colab Notebook

## Project Deliverable
Deliverable is a python notebook that contains my solution:

* Notebook name: Hilton International Hotels Booking Visualisations.ipynb

Dataset Overview:
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

* Dataset name: hotel_bookings.csv

## Recording the Experimental Design
1. Define the Research Question
2. Data Importation
3. Data Exploration
4. Data Cleaning
5. Data Preparation
6. Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate)

Given the dataset, I performed data exploration, data cleaning and analysis in an effort to come with appropriate recommendations. 

As a start while performing data analysis, I derived the following questions from the given dataset: 
1. How many bookings were cancelled?
2. What was the booking ratio between resort hotel and city hotel?
3. What was the percentage of booking for each year?
4. Which was the most busy month for hotel?
5. Most guests came from which country?
6. How long do most people stay in hotels?
7. Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?

## Recommendations

From the above analysis, below are our recommendations:

* Both City Hotels and Resort Hotels should come up with new marketing strategies or improve on already existing ones to cleary advertise on their presence, communicate on the services they offer, deals if any in order to improve on the number of bookings.

* We can see that bookings have increased over the years and inorder to maintain this trend, the hotels can offer special deals/ rates especially during off-peak periods. This will attract more customers and in turn increase the number of bookings hnce and increase in revenue.

* August is one of the busiest months for the Hotel industry. As mentioned earlier the hotels can opt to introduce incentives for any making abooking during the less busier months like January that has a Booking Rate of less than 5%

* To increase on the number of guests coming from different countries, the hotel management may opt to introduce referral programs where a previous guest may get discount rates on their next booking if they reffered someone else who then indeed made a booking.

* To increase on the total number of nights spent at a hotel, management may also opt to add an extra free night for guests who book for 4 or more nights as a perk.

* As noted most bookings are made by couples. The hotel may introduce more family friendly services and activities e.g a playground for children may increase the bookings made by a family.
